<h1> The Best Movies According to Tea </h1>
<h2> My top 3 Netflix TV series of all-time. </h2>
<hr />

<h3> "Orange is the new black" </h3>
<p> Great TV series. It shows some women who after committing a crime are obliged to live together in prison. 
    A mix of drama and comedy</p>

<h3> "YOU" </h3>
<p> Drama, stalker, love, dark humor. I mean wonderful, right?! </p>

<h3> "The Marked Heart" </h3>
<p> A rich man falls in love with a photographer who has to undertake a heart surgery. 
    No donators around. Lucky for her, her husband was rich and evil and found it for her.. in his ways..
